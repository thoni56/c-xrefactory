1.)  This section  applies only  if  you haven't  run the  'c-xrefsetup'
script making those initializations automatically.

2.) In order to make c-xref work under Emacs/XEmacs editors, you have to
set  the  'load-path' variable  in  your  Emacs/XEmacs  editor, so  it
includes the directory containing this  README file.  Then you have to
add the command '(load "c-xrefactory.el")' into your '~/.emacs' file.

**********************************************************************

1.) If  you don't like the  standard c-xref key binding,  you can edit
the file  'c-xrefactory.el' to select  more appropriate one.   You can
also switch between global and (C and Java) mode local key bindings by
setting  the  "c-xref-key-binding"  variable  to  either  "'local"  or
"'global". If  you wish to  completely redefine all key  bindings, put
there the value "'none".  In order  to detect emacs key names, you can
use  the "Ctrl-h l"  emacs function  showing names  of last  100 typed
keys.

2.)  You can edit the 'c-xrefactory.el' file also to appropriate other
customizable  parameters,  like  seting  on/off  syntax  highlighting,
default project name, etc.

3.) If you are using C-Xrefactory installed into system directories of
your  computer, before  customizing  you should  first  copy the  file
'c-xrefactory.el'     from     its     standard     place     (usually
'usr/lib/emacs/site-lisp/c-xrefactory.el')  into  your  directory  and
edit it here.  Then  you should correct the '(load "c-xrefactory.el")'
command in your '~/.emacs' file putting there the path to your copy of
the 'c-xrefactory.el' file.

All C-Xref's macros under (X)Emacs  can be invoked also by selecting the
appropriate line  from the 'C-Xref' menu  of the menu  bar. Standard key
binding is:


F8      - Completion of identifiers. Info on symbols.
F7      - Delete proposition window (if any) created by F8.
F6      - look for cross-references of the selected identifier, 
          push those referencies onto stack,
          go to the definition of the selected identifier (i.e 
          definition of funcion, variable, type name, macro or struct record).
F5      - pop last cross-references pushed by F6, 
          go to the position from where those references were pushed.
F4      - go to the next reference of the top symbol pushed by F6.
F3      - go to the previous reference of the top symbol pushed by F6.
