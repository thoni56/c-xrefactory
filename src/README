Simple build:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  make


Development:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will need to build a special patched version of Berkeley
yacc, which is stored in byacc-1.9 directory.

From the src directory you can do development and coverage builds using

    make unit test coverage-report

Those should also work with -j (parallel builds).

There are a number of convenience targets to. Try

    make -j devel

which will run all unittests, acceptance tests and then generate coverage both as gcov files to be used with Emacs cov-mode and ../coverage/index.html (as per usual genhtml output).

Even more convenient is

    make watch-done

Then go to another terminal or in e.g. Emacs compile-mode and do

    make watch-unit

*then* touch or edit a file and on save see all unittests run
automatically (with Emacs cov-mode giving you unittest coverage in the
fringe) and then, again automatically, run all system/acceptance tests
(again, in Emacs cov-mode show coverage for all current system tests
in the fringe). Just wonderful!
