// 
// This is Xrefactory configuration file. It contains options 
needed to process sources of user's projects. The file contains
an example project configuration, but it needs to be adjusted. 

// For more detailed information about the format of this '_xrefrc' 
// file, please read the 'xrefrcman.txt' file included in our 
// distribution. For more informations about available options read
// the 'xrefman.txt' file.




// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// the following is typical section if Xref is invoked from Emacs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------

// In order to handle multiple user's projects the _xrefrc file is
// divided into sections.  Each section starts by the name of the section
// enclosed into [] brackets. By convention (and for possible automatic
// project detection) the project name is the name of principal directory
// containing your sources.

[c:\myproject\src]    // a section marker

// NOTE: Use the full path including drive letter if you wish to use
// automatic section selection.

// Following specifies source files of the project. Those files are
// processed when invoking xref with the '-create' or '-p' options 
// or when invoked by the 'Create the TAG file' menu item of Emacs.
// You may insert several directory as well as single file names.

-r c:\myproject\src

// The following option specifies where the file containing cross
// references is placed. Please use an absolute path here.

-refs \Xrefs

// The following option specifies the number of files into which the cross 
// references are splitted.
// You should specify the 'refnum' proportionally to the size
// of your project, the recommended number is the number of lines of your 
// sources divided by 3 000. This number specifies also the number of
// cross-reference HTML files.

-refnum=50


// -----------------------------------------------------------------
//                        C specific options
//
// Following options specify default macros for source pre-processing
// Please adjust this if using Xrefactory for C language.

-DDEBUG             // command line macro definition
-DMY_VERSION=2.7    // macro with body

// Following options specify where to search include files.
// Please adjust this!

-I ..\h
-I ..\include
-I ..\..\h
-I ..\..\include
-I ..\..\..\h
-I ..\..\..\include
-I "\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\include"

// Following option causes that editing macros do not update references 
// from include files while answering a request. It is strongly recommended
// to use this option when working on a large project or on a project
// loading large include files (for example MSVC include file).

-noincluderefresh

// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// ----- following options control the form of generated HTML ------

// The following option specifies the directory where the html files 
// created from your sources will be placed. Please use an absolute 
// path here.

-htmlroot=\HTML

// The following option sets the tabulator value for HTML output.

-htmltab=8

// The following options control generating of cross referencing files
// when creating HTML form of sources. Options
// '-htmlgxlist' and '-htmllxlist' specifies respectively whether to 
// generate those lists for global and local symbols. 

-htmlgxlist
// -htmllxlist


// -------------------------------------------------------------------
// Now follows a typical section description if Xref is used from Kawa
// -------------------------------------------------------------------

// Usually you do not need any specific options for Kawa projects.
// This file is of any usage only if you need some particular
// treatment of your project.

// In order to handle multiple user's projects the _xrefrc file is
// divided into sections.  Each section starts by the name of the section
// enclosed into [] brackets. The name should be the same as this
// in Kawa.

[mytestproject]          // project name as it is named in Kawa

// Usually you do not need to specify the cross reference file name,
// and CLASSPATH, as they are taken from Kawa.

// The following option specifies the number of files into which the cross 
// references are splitted.
// You should specify the 'refnum' proportionally to the size
// of your project, the recommended number is the number of lines of your 
// sources divided by 3 000. This number specifies also the number of
// cross-reference HTML files.

-refnum=20

// ----- following options control the form of generated HTML ------
// ------------ (if you wish to generate HTML forms) ---------------

// The following option specifies the directory where the html files 
// created from your sources will be placed. Please use an absolute 
// path here.

-htmlroot=\HTML

// The following option sets the tabulator value for HTML output.

-htmltab=2

// The following options control generating of cross referencing files
// when creating HTML form of sources. Options
// '-htmlgxlist' and '-htmllxlist' specifies respectively whether to 
// generate those lists for global and local symbols. The option
// '-htmlrichlist' specifies whether those lists contain also one
// corresponding line of source code, or not. If you have a fast
// machine and a lot of space on disk, uncomment them all.
