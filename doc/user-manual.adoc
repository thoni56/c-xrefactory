= C-xrefactory User Manual
v{VERSION} - Generated {localdate}

== Introduction

C-xrefactory is a code browser and refactoring tool for C and Yacc, integrated with Emacs. It lets you navigate symbols, find usages, complete code, and safely refactor—all while understanding your code semantically.

All functions are available from the *c-xref* menu in Emacs.

== Getting Started

=== Installation

Clone and load in Emacs:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory
emacs -l c-xrefactory/load.el
----

Or via `el-get`: `M-x el-get-install RET c-xrefactory RET`

See the https://github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory/blob/main/README.md[README] for platform-specific details.

=== Projects

C-xrefactory auto-detects projects based on the file you're editing when you do you initial C-xrefactory operation. The path of the file is investigated upwards until a `.c-xrefrc` (C-xrefactory project config) file is found.

If no config file could be found, you'll be prompted to create a project. The active project is shown in the modeline after each action.

== Browsing

Browsing lets you navigate to definitions and find all usages of any symbol.

=== Basic Navigation

The core workflow uses four actions:

* *Push Symbol and Goto Definition* — resolve the symbol at cursor, jump to its definition
* *Pop Symbol* — return to where you were before pushing
* *Next Reference* — step to the next usage of the current symbol
* *Previous Reference* — step to the previous usage

Place cursor on a symbol, push it, then step through references. When done, pop to return.

=== The Browser Stack

You can browse multiple symbols simultaneously. Each push adds to a stack level:

1. While browsing `variable`, you see it passed to `function`
2. Place cursor on `function` and Push to see its definition
3. Use Next/Previous to navigate all occurrences of `function`
4. Pop to return and continue browsing `variable`

You can Re-Push a symbol you popped.

=== Push by Name

*Push Name and Goto Definition* finds symbols by name only, ignoring scope. Useful when you know a symbol's name but aren't looking at an occurrence of it.

=== Browser Dialog

Opens a visual representation of the browser stack with two panes:

* *Symbol Pane* — shows matched symbols and where they're defined
* *References Pane* — lists all usages with source context

Click a reference to jump to it. Multi-select symbols to combine their references.

== Searching

The Symbol Retriever finds symbols by pattern matching across your entire project.

Use it when you:

* Can't remember a symbol's exact name
* Want to find symbols from libraries
* Need to search by signature pattern

=== Patterns

Patterns use shell-style wildcards:

* `*` — any string (including empty)
* `?` — any single character
* `[abc]` — one of the enclosed characters
* `[a-z]` — character range
* `[^0-9]` — negation (any non-digit)

Searching is case-insensitive except within `[]`.

=== Examples

* `get` or `*get*` — symbols containing "get"
* `init*` — symbols starting with "init"
* `*(*int*)` — functions taking an int parameter

== Completion

Press the completion key (default kbd:[F8]) to complete the identifier at cursor.

C-xrefactory understands context—it offers appropriate completions for function parameters, variable definitions, struct members, etc.

=== Completion Dialog

When multiple completions exist, a dialog appears showing each candidate with its full declaration.

* kbd:[Return] — insert the selected completion
* kbd:[Space] — inspect the symbol's definition
* kbd:[Escape] — cancel and return to editing
* Arrow keys — navigate candidates

== Refactoring

All refactorings are invoked from the *Refactor* menu with cursor on the relevant symbol. C-xrefactory checks that changes won't alter program behavior.

=== Renaming

*Rename Symbol* — changes all occurrences of a variable, function, type, or macro throughout the project.

*Rename Include File* — renames a header file and updates all `#include` directives that reference it.

=== Function Signatures

These work on functions and macros:

*Add Parameter* — adds a new parameter at a specified position, inserting a default value at all call sites.

*Delete Parameter* — removes a parameter from the signature and all calls.

*Move Parameter* — reorders parameters, updating all calls accordingly.

=== Extracting Code

*Extract Function* / *Extract Macro* — select a region of code, then extract it into a new function or macro. C-xrefactory analyzes the code to determine parameters and return values.

=== Finding Unused Code

*Browse File Local Unused* — finds unused local variables, parameters, and labels in the current file.

*Browse Global Unused* — finds unused symbols across the project.

== Quick Reference

=== Recommended Key Bindings

=== Common Workflows

*Find where a function is called:*
Push the function name → step through references with Next/Previous

*Rename a variable safely:*
Cursor on variable → Refactor → Rename Symbol → enter new name

*Extract repeated code:*
Select the code → Refactor → Extract Function → name the new function

*Find all globals starting with "config":*
Symbol Retriever → enter `config*` → browse results
