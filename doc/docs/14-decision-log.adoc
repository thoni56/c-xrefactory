== Decision Log

This chapter provides a historical record of significant design and architectural decisions made during the evolution of c-xrefactory.

=== Overview

The decision log documents choices that have shaped the architecture, implementation, and direction of c-xrefactory. Most decisions from the original 1990s development are lost to history, but as they can be deduced from the codebase and commit history, they are being retroactively documented.

All architectural decisions are recorded using the https://adr.github.io/[Architecture Decision Record (ADR)] format and stored in the `adr/` directory. These ADRs are automatically integrated into the Structurizr documentation system.

=== Viewing Decision Records

The ADRs can be accessed in several ways:

1. **Via Structurizr**: When viewing the https://structurizr.com/[Structurizr documentation], navigate to the "Decisions" section to see all ADRs with cross-references and visualizations.

2. **Directly in the repository**: Browse the link:../../adr/[adr/] directory for markdown files containing individual decision records.

3. **Command line**: Use `ls doc/adr/*.md` from the project root to list all decisions.

=== Decision Categories

Current ADRs cover several categories:

* **Simplification decisions**: Removing unused features (Java support, HTML generation, etc.)
* **Tooling decisions**: Choice of ADR format, documentation system
* **Configuration decisions**: Automatic config file discovery
* **Format decisions**: Reference data storage format

For the complete list of decisions and their rationale, see the link:../../adr/[ADR directory] or the Decisions section in the Structurizr documentation.

=== Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Copy the template from `adr/templates/`
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., `0012-description.md`)
3. Fill in the context, decision, and consequences
4. Commit it alongside the implementation
5. Reference it in commit messages and pull requests

See link:decisions#7[ADR-0007] for details on the ADR format and process.
