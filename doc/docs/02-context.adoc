== Context

`c-xrefactory` is designed to be an aid for programmers as they write,
edit, inspect, read and improve the code they are working on.

The editor is used for usual manual manipulation of the source
code. `C-xrefactory` interacts with the editor to provide navigation
and automated edits, refactorings, through the editor.
