== Functional Overview

The _c-xref_ program is actually a mish-mash of a multitude of
features baked into one program. This is the major cause of the mess
that it is source-wise.

It was

- a generator for persistent cross-reference data
- a reference server for editors, serving cross-reference, navigational and completion data over a protocol
- a refactoring server (the worlds first to cross the Refactoring Rubicon)
- [.line-through]#an HTML cross-reference generator (probably the root of the project)# (REMOVED)
- [.line-through]#a C macro generator for structure fill (and other) functions# (REMOVED)

It is the first three that are unique and constitutes the great value
of this project. The last two have been removed from the source, the
last one because it was a hack and prevented modern, tidy, building,
coding and refactoring. The HTML cross-reference generator has been
superseeded by modern alternatives like Doxygen and is not at the core
of the goal of this project.

One might surmise that it was the HTML-crossreference generator that
was the initial purpose of what the original `Xrefactory` was based
upon. Once that was in place the other followed, and were basically
only bolted on top without much re-architecting the C sources.

What we'd like to do is partition the project into separate parts,
each having a clear usage.

The following sections are aimed at describing various features of
`c-xrefactory`.

=== Options, option files and configuration

The current version of C-xrefactory allows only two possible sets of
configuration/options.

The primary storage is (currently) the file `$HOME/.c-xrefrc`
which stores the "standard" options for all projects. Each project has
a separate section which is started with a section marker, the project
name surrounded by square brackets, `[project1]`.

When you start `c-xref` you can use the command line option `-xrefrc`
to request that a particular option file should be used instead of the
"standard options".

NOTE: When running the edit server there seems to be no way to
indicate a different options files for different
projects/files. Although you can start the server with `-xrefrc` you
will be stuck with that in the whole session and for all projects.

=== LSP

The LSP protocol is a common protocol for language servers such as
`clangd` and `c-xrefactory`. It allows an editor (client) to interface
to a server to request information, such as reference positions, and
operations, such as refactorings, without knowing exactly which server
it talks to.

Recent versions of `c-xrefactory` have an initial implementation of a
very small portion of the LSP protocol. The plan is to fully integrate
the functionality of `c-xrefactory` into the LSP protocol. This will
allow use of `c-xrefactory` from not only Emacs but also Visual Studio
Code or any other editor that supports the LSP protocol.

==== LSP Protocol Limitations

The LSP protocol was designed for single-shot, non-interactive operations.
This creates constraints for c-xrefactory's advanced refactorings:

**Interactive Refactorings**: C-xrefactory's extract/parameter operations
require multi-step user input (names, positions, declarations). LSP's
`textDocument/codeAction` doesn't support interactive dialogs.

**Symbol Browsing**: C-xrefactory provides interactive symbol browsers
with filtering and keyboard navigation. LSP returns flat reference lists
with no standard for interactive UI.

**Strategy**: The LSP implementation aims to:

- Provide basic IDE features (definition, completion, simple refactorings)
  to modern editors
- Expose c-xrefactory's advanced refactoring capabilities where possible
- Keep the Emacs client as the primary interface for full interactive features

LSP serves to make c-xrefactory more accessible while the Emacs client
probably will remain the gateway to its complete refactoring power.
