== Development Environment

=== Developing, here be dragons...

First the code is *terrible*, lots of single and double character
variables (`cc`, `ccc`, ..) and lost of administration on local
variables rather than the structures that are actually there. And
there are also a lot of macros. Unfortunately macros are hard to
refactor to functions. (But I'm making progress...)

As there is no general way to refactor a macro to a function, various
techniques must be applied. I wrote https://www.responsive.se/thomas/2020/05/14/refactoring-macros-to-functions/[a blog post]
about one that have been fairly successful.

But actually it's rather fun to be able to make small changes and
see the structure emerge, hone your refactoring and design skills,
and working on a project that started 20 years ago which still is
valuable, to me, and I hope, to others.

There should probably be a whole section on how to contribute and
develop `c-xrefactory` but until then here's a short list of what
you need:

- C development environment (GNU/Clang/Make/...)
- Unittests are written using https://github.com/cgreen-devs/cgreen[`Cgreen`]
- Clean code and refactoring knowledge (to drive the code to a better and cleaner state)

Helpful would be:

- Compiler building knowledge (in the general sense, Yacc, but AST:s and symbol table stuff are heavily used)
- Java knowledge to be able to bring the Java support up to modern versions (probably not going to happen...)

=== Setup

TBD.

=== Building

You should be able build `c-xref` using something like (may have changed over time...)

    cd src
    make
    make unit
    make test

But since the details of the building process are somewhat contrieved
and not so easy to see through, here's the place where that should be
described.

One step in the build process was generating initialization information
for all the things in standard include files, which of course became
very dependent on the system you are running this on. This has now moved
into functions inside `c-xref` itself, like finding DEFINEs and include
paths.

The initial recovered c-xrefactory relied on having a working _c-xref_
for the current system. I don't really know how they managed to do
that for all the various systems they were supporting.

Modern thinking is that you should always be able to build from
source, so this is something that needed change. We also want to
distribute _c-xref_ as an el-get library which requires building from
source and should generate a version specific for the current system.

[.line-through]#The strategy selected, until some better idea comes along, is to try
to build a _c-xref.bs_, if there isn't one already, from the sources in
the repository and then use that to re-generate the definitions and
rebuild a proper _c-xref_. See Bootstrapping.#

We have managed to remove the complete bootstrapping step, so `c-xrefactory`
now builds like any other project.

=== Versions

The current sources are in 1.6.X range. This is the same as the orginal
xrefactory and probably also the proprietary C++ supporting version.

There is an option, "-xrefactory-II", that might indicate that
something was going on. But currently the only difference seems to be
if the edit server protocol output is in the form of non-structured
fprintf:s or using functions in the `ppc`-family (either calling
`ppcGenRecord()` or `fprint`ing using some PPC-symbol). This, and
hinted to in how the emacs-part starts the server and some initial
server option variables in refactory.c, indicates that the
communication from the editor and the refactory server is using
this. It does *not* look like this is a forward to next generation
attempt.

What we should do is investigate if this switch actually is used
anywhere but in the editor server context, and if so, if it can be
made the default and the 'non-xrefactory-II' communication removed.

=== Coding ===

==== Naming ====

_C-xref_ started (probably) as a cross-referencer for the languages
supported (C, Java, C++), orginally had the name "xref" which became
"xrefactory" when refactoring support was added. And when Mari√†n
released a "C only" version in 2009 some of all "xref" references was
changed to "c-xref". So, as most software, there is a history and a
naming legacy to remember.

Here are some of the conventions in naming that are being used:

olcx::
"On-line CX" (Cross-reference) ?

OLO::
"On-line option" - some kind of option for the server

==== Modules and Include Files ====

The source code for `c-xrefactory` was using a very old C style with a
separate `proto.h` where all prototypes for all externally visible
functions were placed. Definitions are all over the place and it was
hard to see where data is actually declared. This must change into
module-oriented include-strategy.

Of course this will have to change into the modern x.h/x.c externally
visible interface model so that we get clean modules that can be
unittested.

The function prototypes have been now moved out to header files for
each "module". Some of the types have also done that, but this is
still a work in progress.



=== Debugging

TBD. Attachning `gdb`, `server-driver`...

`yaccp` from `src/.gdbinit` can ease the printing of Yacc semantic data fields...

A helpful option is the recently added `-commandlog=...` which allows
you to capture all command arguments sent to the server/xref process
to a file. This makes it possible to capture command sequences and
"replay" them. Useful both for debugging and creating tests.

=== Testing

==== Unittests ====

There are very few unittests at this point, only covering single digit
percent of the code. The "units" in this project are unclear and
entangled so creating unittests is hard since it was not build to be
tested, test driven or even clearly modularized.

All unittests use `Cgreen` as the unittest framework. If you are
unfamiliar with it the most important point is that it can mock
functions, so you will find mock implementations of all external
functions for a module in a corresponding `<module>.mock` file.

Many modules are at least under test, meaning there is a
<module>_tests.c in the unittest directory. Often only containing an
empty test.

==== Acceptance Tests

In the `tests` directory you will find tests that exercise the external
behaviour of `c-xref`. Some tests actually do only that, they wouldn't
really count as tests.

Most acceptance tests are hacks at this point, Make-scripts tweaked
until it produces some expected output. But at least they get the
coverage up (working our way up to the mid 60%), and more are added as
bugs are found so they provide increasing confidence when developing.

There are two basic strategies for the tests:

- run a `c-xref` command, catch its output and verify
- run a series of command using the EDIT_SERVER_DRIVER, collect output and results and verify

Some tests do not even test its output and only provide coverage.

Some tests do a very bad job at verifying, either because my
understanding at that time was very low, or because it is hard to
verify the output. E.g. the "test" for generate references are only
grepping the CXrefs files for some strings, not verifying that they
actually point to the correct place.

Hopefully this will change as the code gets into a better state and
the understanding grows.

==== General Setup

Since all(?) `c-xref` operation rely on an options file which must
contain absolute file paths (because the server runs as a separate
process) it must be generated whenever the tests are to be run in a
different location (new clone, test was renamed, ...).

This is performed by using a common template in `tests` and a target
in `tests/Maefile.boilerplate`.

Each test should have a `clean` target that removes any temporary and
generated files, including the `.c-xrefrc` file and generated
references. This way it is easy to ensure that all tests have updated
`.c-xrefrc` files.

==== Edit Server Driver Tests

Since many operations are performed from the editor, and the editor
starts an "edit server" process, many tests need to emulate this
behaviour.

The edit server session is mostly used for navigation. Refactorings
are actually performed as separate invocations of `c-xref`.

In `utils` there is a `server_driver.py` script, which will take as
input a file containing a sequence of commands. You can use this to
start an edit, refactory or reference server session and then feed it
with commands in the same fashion as an editor would do. The script
also handles the communication through the buffer file (see [Editor
Interface](./Design:-Editor-Interface)).

==== Creating More Edit Server Tests

You can relatively easy re-create a sequence of interactions by using the
sandboxed Emacs in `tests/sandboxed_emacs`.

There are two ways to use it, "make spy" or "make pure". With the
"spy" an intermediate spy is injected between the editor and the edit
server, capturing the interaction to a file.

With "pure" you just get the editor setup with `c-xref-debug-mode` and
`c-xref-debug-preserve-tmp-files` on. This means that you can do what
ever editor interactions you want and see the communication in the
`\*Messages*` buffer. See [Editor Interface](./Design:-Editor-Interface)
for details.

Once you have figure out which part of the `\*Messages*` buffer are
interesting you can copy that out to a file and run
`utils/messages2commands.py` on it to get a file formatted for input
to `server_driver.py`.

NOTE: the `messages2commands` script converts all occurrences of the
current directory to CURDIR so it is handy to be in the same directory
as the sources when you run the conversion.

NOTE: the `messages2commands` script removes any `-preload` so you
need to take care that the positions inside the buffers are not
changed between interactions lest the `-olcursor` and `-olmark` will
be wrong. (You can just undo the change after a refactoring or
rename). Of course this also applies if you want to mimic a sequence
of refactorings, like the `jexercise` move method example. Sources will
then change so the next refactoring works from content of buffers, so you
have to handle this specifically.

NOTE: `-preload` is the mechanism where the editor can send modified
buffers to `c-xref` so thay you don't have to save between
refactorings, which is particularly important in the case of extract
since the extraction creates a default name which the editor then does
a rename of.


=== Utilities

==== Covers

`utils/covers.py` is a Python script that, in some enviroments, can list which test cases execute a particular line.

This is handy when you want to debug or step through a particular part of the code.
Find a test that covers that particular line and run it using the debugger (usually `make debug` in the test directory).

Synopsis:

    covers.py <file> <line>

==== Sandboxed

`utils/sandboxed` starts a sandboxed Emacs that uses the current elisp code and the `c-xref` from src.
This allows you to run a test changes without having to polute your own setup.

This actually runs the `tests/sandboxed_emacs` pure version, which also sets up a completely isolated Emacs environment with its own packages loaded, configuration etc.
See below.

Synopsis:

    sandboxed
    
=== Debugging the protocol

There is a "pipe spy" in `tests/sandboxed_emacs`. You can build the
spy using

    make spy

and then start a sandboxed Emacs which invokes the spy using

    make

This Emacs will be sandboxed to use its own .emacs-files and have HOME
set to this directory.

The spy will log the communication between Emacs and the *real*
`c-xref` (`src/c-xref`) in log files in `/tmp`.

NOTE that Emacs will invoke several instanced of what it believes is
the real `c-xref` so there will be several log files to inspect.
