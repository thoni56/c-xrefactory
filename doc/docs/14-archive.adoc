== Archive

In this section you can find some descriptions and saved texts that
described how things were before. They are no longer true, since that
quirk, magic or bad coding is gone. But it is kept here as an archive
for those wanting to do backtracking to original sources.

=== Trivial Prechecks ===

The refactorer can call the server using `parseBufferUsingServer()` and add some extra options (in text form).
One example is `setMovingPrecheckStandardEnvironment()` where it calls the server with `-olcxtrivialprecheck`.

However `parseBufferUsingServer()` uses `callServer()` which never `answerEditAction()`.

In `answerEditAction()` the call to (unused) `olTrivialRefactoringPreCheck()` also requires an `options.trivialPreCheckCode` which is neither send by `setMovingPrecheckStandardEnvironment()` nor parsed by `processOptions()`.

The only guess I have is that previously all prechecks where handled by the `-olcxtrivialprecheck` option in calls to the server, and have now moved to their respective refactorings.

NOTE: This theory should be checked by looking at the original source of the precheck functions and compare that with any possible checks in the corresponding refactoring code.

=== HUGE Memory ===

Previously a HUGE model was also available (by re-compilation) to
reach file numbers, lines and columns above 22 bits. But if you have
more than 4 million lines (or columns!) you should probably do
something radical before attempting cross referencing and refactoring.


=== Bootstrapping

==== BOOTSTRAP REMOVED!

Once the FILL-macros was removed, we could move the enum-generation to
use the actual `c-xref`. So from now on we build `c-xref` directly
from the sources in the repo. Changes to any enums will trigger a
re-generation of the enumTxt-files but since the enumTxt-files are
only conversion of enum values to strings any mismatch will not
prevent compilation, and it would even be possible to a manual
update. This is a big improvement over the previous situation!

==== FILLs REMOVED!

As indicated in <<FILL macros>> the bootstrapping of FILL-macros has
finally and fully been removed.

Gone is also the `compiler_defines.h`, which was just removed without
any obvious adverse effects.  Maybe that will come back and bite me
when we move to more platforms other than linux and MacOS...

Left is, at this point, only the `enumTxt` generation, so most of the
text below is kept for historical reasons.

==== Rationale

_c-xref_ uses a load of structures, and lists of them, that need to be
created and initialized in a lot of places (such as the parsers). To
make this somewhat manageable, _c-xref_ itself parses the strucures
and generates macros that can be used to fill them with one call.

_c-xref_ is also bootstrapped into reading in a lot of predefined
header files to get system definitions as "preloaded
definitions".

Why this pre-loading was necessary, I don't exactly know. It
might be an optimization, or an idea that was born early and then just
kept on and on. In any case it creates an extra complexity
building and maintaining and to the structure of _c-xref_.

So this must be removed, see below.

==== Mechanism

The bootstrapping uses _c-xref_'s own capability to parse C-code and
parse those structures and spit out filling macros, and some other
stuff.

This is done using options like `-task_regime_generate' which prints a
lot of data structures on the standard output which is then fed into
generated versions of _strFill_, _strTdef_(no longer exists) and
_enumTxt_ by the Makefile.

The process starts with building a _c-xref.bs_ executable from checked
in sources. This compile uses a BOOTSTRAP define that causes some
header files to include pre-generated versions of the generated files
(currently _strFill.bs.h_ and _enumTxt.bs.h_) which should work in all
environments.

NOTE: if you change the name of a field in a structure that is subject
to FILL-generation you will need to manually update the
_strFill.bs.h_, but a "make cleaner all" will show you where those are.

After the _c-xref.bs_ has been built, it is used to generate _strFill_
and _enumTxt_ which might include specific structures for the current
environment.

HOWEVER: if FILL macros are used for structures which are different on
some platforms, say a FILE structure, that FILL macro will have
difference number of arguments, so I'm not sure how smart this "smart"
generation technique actually is.

TODO: Investigate alternative approaches to this generate "regime",
perhaps move to a "class"-oriented structure with initialization
functions for each "class" instead of macros.

==== Compiler defines ====

In _options.h_ there are a number of definitions which somehow are
sent to the compiler/preprocessor or used so that standard settings
are the same as if a program will be compiled using the standard
compiler on the platform. At this point I don't know exactly how this
conversion from C declarations to compile time definitions is done,
maybe just entered as symbols in one of the many symboltables?

Typical examples include "__linux" but also on some platforms things
like "fpos_t=long".

I've implemented a mechanism that uses "gcc -E -mD" to print out and
catch all compiler defines in `compiler_defines.h`. This was necessary
because of such definitions on Darwin which where not in the
"pre-programmed" ones.

TODO?: As this is a more general approach it should possibly
completely replace the "programmed" ones in `options.c`?

==== EnumTxt generation REMOVED! ====

To be able to print the string values of enums the module generate.c
(called when regime was RegimeGenerate) could also generate string
arrays for all enums. By replacing that with some pre-processor magic
for the few that was actually needed (mostly in log_trace() calls) we
could do away with that whole "generate" functionality too.

(Last commit with enum generation intact is https://github.com/thoni56/c-xrefactory/commit/aafd7b1f813f2c17c684ea87ac87a0be31cdd4c4.)

==== enumTxt

For some cases the string representing the value of an Enum is needed.
`c-xref` handles this using the "usual" 'parse code and generate' method.
The module `generate.c` does this generation too.

==== Include paths

Also in _options.h_ some standard-like include paths are added, but
there is a better attempt in _getAndProcessGccOptions()_ which uses
the compiler/preprocessor itself to figure out those paths.

TODO?: This is much better and should really be the only way, I think.

==== Problems

Since at bootstrap there must exist FILL-macros with the correct field
names this strategy is an obstacle to cleaning up the code since every
field is referenced in the FILL macros. When a field (in a structure
which *are* filled using the FILL macro) changes name, this will make
initial compilation impossible until the names of that field is also
changed in the `strFill.bs.h` file.

One way to handle this is of course to use `c-xrefactory` itself and
rename fields. This requires that the project settings also include a
pass with BOOTSTRAP set, which it does.

==== Removing

I've started removing this step. In TODO.org I keep a hierarchical list
of the actions to take (in a Mikado kind of style).

The basic strategy is to start with structures that no other structure
depends on. Using the script `utils/struct2dot.py` you can generate a
DOT graph that shows those dependencies.

Removal can be done in a couple of ways

1. If it's a very small structure you can replace a call to a `FILL_XXX()` macro
with a https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Compound-Literals.html[compound literal].

2. A better approach is usually to replace it with a `fillXXX()` function, or even
better, with a `newXXX()`, if it consistently is preceeded with an allocation
(in the same memory!). To see what fields vary you can grep all such calls, make a
CSV-file from that, and compare all rows.

==== strTdef.h

The `strTdef.h` was generated using the option `-typedefs` as a part
of the old `-task_regime_generate` strategy and generated typedef
declarations for all types found in the parsed files.

I also think that you could actually merge the struct definition with
the typedef so that _strTdef.h_ would not be needed. But it seems that
this design is because the structures in _proto.h_ are not a directed
graph, so loops makes that impossible. Instead the typedefs are
included before the structs:

    #include "strTdef.h"

    struct someNode {
        S_someOtherNode *this;
        ...

    struct someOtherNode {
        S_someNode *that;
        ...

This is now ideomatically solved using the structs themselves:

    struct someNode {
        struct someOtherNode *this;
        ...

    struct someOtherNode {
        struct someNode *that;
        ...

=== FILL macros

_**The FILL macros are now fully replaced by native functions or some other,**_
_**more refactoring-friendly, mechanism. Yeah!**_***

During bootstrapping a large number of macros named ____FILL_xxxx__ is
created. The intent is that you can fill a complete structure with one
call, somewhat like a constructor, but here it's used more generally
every time a complex struct needs to be initialized.

There are even ___FILLF_xxx__ macros which allows filling fields in
sub-structures at the same time.

This is, in my mind, another catastrophic hack that makes
understanding, and refactoring, `c-xrefactory` such a pain. Not to
mention the extra bootstrap step.

I just discovered the compound literals of C99. And I'll experiment
with replacing some of the FILL macros with compound literals assignments
instead.

    FILL_symbolList(memb, pdd, NULL);

could become (I think):

    memb = (SymbolList){.d = pdd, .next = NULL};


If successful, it would be much better, since we could probably get
rid of the bootstrap, but primarily it would be more explicit about
which fields are actually necessary to set.

=== Users

**The `-user` option has now been removed, both in the tool and the
  editor adaptors, and with it one instance of a hashlist, the
  `olcxTab`, which now is a single structure, the `sessionData`.**

There is an option called `-user` which Emacs sets to the frame-id. To
me that indicates that the concept is that for each frame you create
you get a different "user" with the `c-xref` server that you (Emacs)
created.

The jedit adapter seems to do something similar:

    options.add("-user");
    Options.add(s.getViewParameter(data.viewId));

Looking at the sources to find when the function
`olcxSetCurrentUser()` is called it seems that you could have
different completion, refactorings, etc. going on at the same time in
different frames.

Completions etc. requires user interaction so they are not controlled
by the editor in itself only. At first glance though, the editor
(Emacs) seems to block multiple refactorings and referencs maintenance
tasks running at the same time.

This leaves just a few use cases for multiple "users", and I think it
adds unnecessary complexity. Going for a more "one user" approach,
like the model in the language server protocol, this could really be
removed.
