**********************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a message of form:

:[warning] main.c:160 ,can't open file tin.h

This  means that  the directory  containing  the 'tin.h'  file is  not
specified  in  your include  paths.   You  should  edit your  personal
'~/.xrefrc' file and add there the

    -I directory

option, where directory is the directory containing the 'tin.h' file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While creating cross references of a file 'myfile.c' you see a message
like:

'myfile.c'
:[warning] stdlib.h:32 ,     can't open file stddef.h

meaning that  the file 'stddef.h',  included from the  standard header
'stdlib.h', was not found. This  can occur when your compiler is using
non standard include  directories. In this case you  have to determine
which directory contains 'stdlib.h'  and add this directory, using the
'-I' option,  into your '~/.xrefrc'  file.  In order to  determine the
include  directory of your  compiler, you  can pre-process  your input
file with your compiler and look for the place where the searched file
was included, i.e. (following our example) type:

    gcc -E myfile.c | grep "stddef.h"

and you will obtain an output in the form:

 #line 1 "/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/include/stddef.h" 1 3

Here you see the directory containing the file in question and you can
now add the line:

    -I /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/include

to your '.xrefrc' file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While calling code completion you receive the error message:

    '[error] sorry, memory mbMemory overflowed over borne'

The macro-body  memory overflowed. This  probably means that  you have
invoked  the completion  inside  a macro  invocation  with no  closing
parentheses. Just  put a closing parenthesis after  the macro argument
and  call  the completion  again.  If this  does  not  work, read  the
following item.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
You receive an error message of the form :

    '[error] sorry, memory XXX overflowed over borne'

This means  that some internal memory table  overflowed.  This problem
occurs when your files are bigger than expected.  In the 'src/head2.h'
file find  the corresponding constant, which should  be something like
SIZE_XXX,  adjust it  to  fit your  application  size, and  re-compile
Xrefactory.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a message like:

    "[error] position over MAX_REFERENCABLE_LINE" 
or
    "[error] position over MAX_REFERENCABLE_COLUMN" 


It means  that your  program is  too long. There  are either  too many
lines in a  single file, or a  line which is too long.  In either case
you  will need to  download the  source based  Xrefactory distribution
'xref-any' and put following line:

#define XREF_HUGE 1

into 'src/head2.h' file. Then recompile Xrefactory from sources.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a message like:

    "[warning] cx_memory resizing required" 

This happens  when the memory which stores  cross references overflows
and  cannot be  resized  anymore.   If this  happens  when calling  an
editing macro  you should probably put the  "-noincluderefs" option in
your  .xrefrc   option  file.   If   this  does  not  help   edit  the
'src/head2.h'  file  and  increase the  CX_MEMORY_CHUNK_SIZE  constant
value  and recompile.   If the  message appears  while  creating cross
references  you will  need to  either  use the  "-mf<n>" command  line
option,  or  increase  the  CX_MEMORY_CHUNK_SIZE constant  as  in  the
previous case.
