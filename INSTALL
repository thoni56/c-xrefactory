This is install instructions for portable source distribution of
C-xrefactory.

1.) In order to create the distribution, goto the directory containing
this file and type:

        sh ./CreateXrefDistribution

(or simply make). If everything is going all right, you will find the
'c-xref' directory along the original 'c-xrefactory' directory.  This
directory contains a working distribution containing all files needed
to install and run Xrefactory.  Go there and follow instructions
written there in the README or INSTALL file.

In following text, let XREFDIR be the directory containing this file.

1.)  First compile xref sources.  They are stored in XREFDIR/src
directory.  If you have 'make' or 'gmake' installed on your computer
then invoke it in the 'src' directory. This will produce an executable
task (named c-xref or c-xref.exe, ...). You can check it from command
line by invoking it with -about option:

    c-xref -about

Now you need to install Xrefactory under your environment:

2.)  Emacs/XEmacs installation: Copy files XREFDIR/env/emacs/c-xref.el
and XREFDIR/env/emacs/c-xrefactory.el to directory containing your
Emacs lisp code. Then add line:

	(load "c-xrefactory")

to your ~/.emacs file.  Finally, modify your PATH variable (or
equivalent on your system), so that command 'c-xref' invokes the
executable c-xref compiled in step 1.

*      Developing Xrefactory                                         *
**********************************************************************


1.) If you actively develop c-xref and modify sources, you will need a
working copy of c-xref task in xref.bs file (because c-xref is partially
bootstrapped).  So before doing your first source file modification,
do the following!

  make
  make bs

then, you  can modify source files  and rebuild simply by make. 

2.) You will need to build Berkeley yacc, which is stored in byacc-1.9
directory.

NOTE: At this point it is not known which of all byacc versions
actually work. The version that works should have "int lastyystate;"
in the generated y.tab.c.

Here are some versions that do *not* work:

- ftp://invisible-island.net/byacc/byacc.tar.gz
  Linked to by http://invisible-island.net/byacc/byacc.html ("The source")

- ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/byacc.1.9.tar.Z
  Linked to from e.g. http://invisible-island.net/byacc/byacc.html
  under "Related links"

- http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/devel/compiler-tools/yacc-1.9.1.tar.Z
  Linked to by http://linux.freesoftware0.com/download/byacc-191-414e61e0.html


3.) You will also need to update file dependeces from time to time by
the command:

  make dependencies

4.) To compile xref with debugging options use:

  make -f Makefile.development
