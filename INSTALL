This is README file for portable source distribution of Xrefactory. 

**********************************************************************
*    Auto Create Xrefactory Distribution                             *
**********************************************************************

1.) In order to create the distribution, goto the directory containing
this file and type:

        sh ./CreateXrefDistribution

(or simply make). If everything is  going all right, you will find the
'c-xref' directory along  the original 'c-xrefactory' directory.  This
directory contains a working  distribution containing all files needed
to  install and  run  Xrefactory.  Go  there  and follow  instructions
written there in the README or INSTALL file.

In following text, let XREFDIR be the directory containing this file.

1.)   First compile  xref  sources.  They  are  stored in  XREFDIR/src
directory.  If you  have 'make' or 'gmake' installed  on your computer
then invoke it in the 'src' directory. This will produce an executable
task (named xref or xref.exe, ...). You can check it from command line
by invoking it with -about option:

    xref -about

Now you need to install Xrefactory under your environment:

2.)   Emacs/XEmacs installation: Copy  files XREFDIR/env/emacs/xref.el
and XREFDIR/env/emacs/xrefactory.el to directory containing your Emacs
lisp code. Then add line:

	(load "xrefactory")

to  your ~/.emacs file.  Finally, appropriate  your PATH  variable (or
equivalent  on  your  system),  so  that command  'xref'  invokes  the
executable xref compiled in step 1.

3.)   jEdit installation:  Copy  file XREFDIR/env/jedit/Xrefactory.jar
into  your  jEdit  plugins  directory (usualy  ~/.jedit/jars  or  jars
subdirectory  of  jEdit  installation  directory). Then  create  empty
directory 'Xrefactory' in your jedit plugins directory (the same where
you have copied Xrefactory.jar) and copy there 'XREFDIR/src/xref' task
created in step 1.



**********************************************************************
*      Developing Xrefactory                                         *
**********************************************************************


1.) If you  actively develop xref and modify sources,  you will need a
working copy of  xref task in xref.bs file  (because xref is partially
bootstrapped).  So  before doing your first  source file modification,
do the following!

  make
  make bs

then, you  can modify source files  and rebuild simply by make. 

2.) You will need to build Berkeley yacc, which is stored in byacc-1.9
directory.

3.) You will also need to  update file dependeces from time to time by
the command:

  make dependencies

4.) To compile xref with debugging options use:

  make -f Makefile.development
