/*

            Welcome to the C-Xrefactory exercise project!

  1.)  The basic hot-keys you need to know are: F6 which brings you to
  the definition of a symbol, and F5 which brings you back.

  2.)  With this knowledges you can browse demonstration files. Put
  cursor on a function name, say 'completions', and press F6 to go to
  completion's examples.

  At the first invocation C-Xrefactory will ask you for creation of a
  new project.  You should answer 'yes' (create new project).
  C-xrefactory will then ask a few questions, if you do not know
  the answer, press <return> to select default value.

   Under Emacs/XEmacs, you can get help on any of C-Xrefactory
   functions by typing 'C-h k' key combination (i.e. 'control'
   together with 'h' key, followed by 'k' key) and select the function
   from 'C-xref' menu with mouse.
