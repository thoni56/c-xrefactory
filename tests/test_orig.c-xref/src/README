Simple build:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  make dependencies
  make



Development:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you will need to build Berkeley yacc, which is stored in
byacc-1.9 directory. Second,  you will need a copy of a working
copy of xref task in xref.bs file (because xref is partially 
bootstrapped). Todo this, you can call:

  make bs

then, you can modify source files and rebuild. To compile xref
with debugging options use:

  make -f Makefile.development
