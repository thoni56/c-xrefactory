# Test to see if uint32 is defined

# GCC 10 and up defines it using DEFINEs or typedefs which works
# automatically.  Some other compilers might not. As we now have
# introduced a possibility to discover which compiler is used, it is
# possible to inject the predefined symbols that C99 and later defines
# (like _Bool).  For now this only works for GCC, not for clang

# How c-xrefactory gets include paths:
#     LANG=C gcc -v -x c -o /dev/null /dev/null >out 2>&1

# and include standard defines:
#    gcc -E -dM - >out 2>&1

# And this should be what c-xrefactory actually sees
# gcc -E source.c
