    The first thing you have to do (if not yet done) is to create a
    new C-xrefactory project.  To do this select "C-xref -> Project ->
    New" item from the (X)Emacs menu bar.  It will pose you few
    questions, just answer them by default (proposed) values. Then,
    you should invoke the "C-xref->Create C-xref Tags" menu item in
    order to create cross-references for this project.  The F7 key
    deletes the new window after.  Note that any of functions
    presented in following examples can be accessed via the 'C-xref'
    menu item on the top of your Emacs/XEmacs screen.
