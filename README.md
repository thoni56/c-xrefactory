# C-xrefactory — A refactoring tool for C/Yacc and Emacs

## TL;DR

`c-xrefactory` is a free Emacs refactoring tool and code browser for
_C_ & _Yacc_.

> **BEWARE**: As `c-xrefactory` is undergoing radical refactorings and
> changes and doesn't have tests for all features occasional hiccups
> are likely. I use it almost everyday and the stable version, which you
> get if you install as per below, has passed all tests. But YMMV.

## Install

The easiest, and currently only supported, way to install is using
`el-get`:

    M-x el-get-install<ENTER>c-xrefactory<ENTER>

> **NOTE**: You can easily install `el-get` in your running emacs using
> a snippet from [`el-get`'s GitHub repo][el-get repo], but don't forget
> to add the `el-get` pieces to your emacs init.

## Example Use

Place cursor on an identifier and `go to definition` (<kbd>F6</kbd>),
navigate between occurrences (<kbd>F3</kbd>, <kbd>F4</kbd>), refactor
(<kbd>F11</kbd>) with `rename`, mark some code and `extract function`.
Your C programming and code will never be the same. Some highlights:

- navigate through all usages of any type of symbol
- rename any type of symbol, variable, macro, parameter,
  or Yacc grammar rule
- add or delete function parameter
- extract function or macro
- detect unused symbols locally or in the complete project

When installed correctly there will be an Emacs menu called `C-xref`
for easy access to most functions.

## Tutorial

Once you have that menu in Emacs you can try the Tutorial under
`C-xref->C-xref Misc`.  It will automatically create the tutorial
project files in a temporary directory and open the initial file.
Then just follow the instructions for a quick walk-through of what
`c-xrefactory` can do.

## Setup

If your Emacs runs in a "standard" *ix-like environment with `bash`,
`make`, `cc` etc. you probably don't need anything in particular.

`c-xrefactory` works with recent Emacsen on Linux, including WSL,
Cygwin, Msys2-MSYS (but not Msys2-MingW*) and MacOS/Darwin.

For Windows I really recommend doing your development in WSL
(especially WSL2). You can setup `c-xrefactory` as described above and
run Emacs in a terminal window without any problems.

To use Emacs in a graphical environment from WSL (in an X11 window) you
need a Windows X11 server like [VcXsrv] (my recommendation), [X410]
(from the Windows Store), [Xming] or, if you already have [MobaXterm],
that also comes with an X11 server. Then setup the server according
to [these instructions][X11 WSL2].

## Features and notes

TBD. Some documentation can be found [here][our docs]. We are also
trying out [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/share/51829) for the
documentation.

### Yacc special features

C code inside semantic actions in a Yacc file will be analysed so that
you can (mostly) navigate symbols even inside them.

Non-terminals (rule names) can be navigated and completed as if they
were any other symbol. Furthermore the special symbol `$<n>`, where
&lt;n&gt; is a number referencing symbol &lt;n&gt; in the rule can also
be navigated. This is extra handy with <kbd>F6</kbd> to be sure that
you referenced the terminal or non-terminal that you meant to.

Unfortunately there are no refactorings of Yacc rules possible (but
that would be a cool project!). But you can of course do all the C
refactorings you want from inside the C code in the semantic actions.

### LSP

As noted in one issue, a natural development would be to support LSP
(The [Language Server Protocol]), but that is still far out of reach.
A lot of refactoring needs to be done to clean up the current modules
and protocol to get closer to that point.

### Java notes

> **NOTE**: Java support has been removed since there are far better
> options now.

The current Java grammar has not been updated from Java 1.4, but since
`c-xrefactory` recovers gracefully that is not a major problem except
for the fact that you can't for certain navigate all symbols inside
construct that was introduced in later Java versions.

You need to have a JRE installed so that it can be found. If it's
Java 8 it will also be parsed for all Java standard library
symbols. Unfortunately later versions does not store JRE in a
standardized format (which was Jar-files with class files) so
`c-xrefactory` cannot read it. You can still compile with Java &gt; 8
and use `c-xrefactory` with a Java 8 JRE.

NOTE: As there are good Java tools available with refactoring support
I'm thinking of removing all Java support from `c-xrefactory` since
that complicates a lot of things. And some of the cool solutions don't
work any longer, like navigating Java library symbols by loading the
jar-files that were part of any Java install up to Java 8.

## Help!

This code is pre-historic legacy. It seems to have been born in a
world of copy-paste-hack-and-debug, there were no unit tests, or any
tests at all for that matter.

I'm on a long-time quest to resurrect this code to understandable,
maintainable and developable standard. This is hard work, difficult
and time consuming, as it is almost impossible to understand what
anything does. At this point we have reached almost 75% test coverage
which makes me confident in refactoring many things.

If you think you can help, I'll be happy to take it, even if it is
only adding one line of understanding in the wiki...

## Development and Documentation

There are some information about my current understanding of this
beast in the design documentation. And there is a budding user
manual. Those documents are continually published into the
[C-xrefactory documentation site](https://thoni56.github.io/c-xrefactory).

These documents are in no means complete, or perhaps not even
readable, but are attempts to continually collect bits and pieces of
information from old documents and newly found knowledge.

The information stored in the wiki has been transferred into these
documents and the wiki has been removed.

## The Story

Once apon a time there was [www.xref.sk], a site promoting possibly the
worlds first refactoring browser to cross the ["Refactoring's Rubicon"].
That site seems to be going up and (mostly) down and there has been no
support for many years, but it seems that [www.xrefactory.com] is now a
better and more stable URL to the original Xrefactory, where it is
still available.

At that time it had a free Java and C version, and a paid C++
version. Development seems to have been headed by a [Marián Vittek].

Marián made a C-version, `c-xref`, available under GPL already 2009 on
[SourceForge][c-xref]. The reason seems to have been to allow parallel
installations of free and non-free versions. `c-xref` seems to be
intended to be limited to C and Emacs. Actually it's not. It is all
but identical to the original full/free C/Java refactoring browser
from [www.xref.sk]. So Java is also still supported, at least Java
1.4. Although it might not be some time in the future (as there are
other Java refactoring tools available).

## About This Clone

As I'm almost dependent on this and refactoring tools for C is sadly
missing, I decided to pick this up and work a bit on it, and maybe even
[give it more visibility][c-xref], by moving it to GitHub.

No-one would be more happy than me if the C++ version was also put
in the public domain.

If someone is in contact with Marián, please inform him and ask him to
contact me. Perhaps we can create something great from this, together
with others who might be interested.
