# C-xrefactory - A refactoring tool for C/Java and Emacs

Once apon a time there was [http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk), a
site promoting possibly the worlds first refactoring browser to cross
the ["Refactoring's
Rubicon"](http://martinfowler.com/articles/refactoringRubicon.html).

At that time it had a free Java and C version, and a paid C++
version. Development seems to have been headed by a [Marián
Vittek](http://dai.fmph.uniba.sk/w/Marian_Vittek/en).

Marián have been hard to track down and
[http://www.xref.sk](http://www.xref.sk) seems to be going up and
(mostly) down and there has been no support for many years.

Marián made a C-version, c-xref, available under GPL already 2009 on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/) which seems to
be intended to be limited to C and Emacs. Actually it's not, Java is still 

As I'm almost dependent on this and refactoring tools for C is sadly
lacking, I decided to pick this up and work a bit on it, maybe even
make it a [bit more visible](http://sourceforge.net/projects/c-xref/),
by moving it to GitHub. Although C-xref pretends to be only for C, it
is all but identical to the full C/Java browser.

No-one would be more happy than me if the C++ version where also put
in the public domain.

If someone has contact with Marián, please inform him and ask him to
contact me. Perhaps we can create something great from this together
with others who might be interested.
