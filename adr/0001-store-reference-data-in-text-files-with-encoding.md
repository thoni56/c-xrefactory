## Where to store reference data in an effective and compact format

### Y-Statement

_In the context of_ effectively and compactly percisting reference data stored on disk,
_facing the fact_ that we need to access it quickly and that it should always reflect the current content of source files
_we decided for_ custom optimized and encoded file storage
_and neglected_ database or free text storage
_to achieve_ some level of storage
_accepting_ complexity of access code and performance hits,
_because_ it seemed right at the time.
    
### Decision Drivers

* Previous format seems to have been a more clear text version and the concern was (maybe) space on disk
* Compacting the clear text format by encoding data, avoiding duplicate information due to space considerations?

### Considered Options

* Unknown

### Decision Outcome

Current intricately encoded text format...
